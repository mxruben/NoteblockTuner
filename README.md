# Noteblock Tuner

Noteblock Tuner allows you to tune noteblocks in Minecraft with a MIDI keyboard. To use it, start the program and select your input device. Then, in the game, simply point your crosshair at an untuned noteblock and press a valid note on your keyboard. It should translate that keypress to the number of right clicks required to tune to that note.
